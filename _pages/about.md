I am a passionate and driven individual with a relentless curiosity for new things. I thrive on challenges and constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. My interests lie at the intersection of <b>Computer Vision, Security and Robotics </b>. I am fascinated by how technology can bridge the gap between humans and machines, and I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions in these fields. I also take a deep interest in reading about these areas and spend a significant amount of time delving into research papers to stay updated and informed. Whether it's tackling a complex problem or learning a new concept, I am always eager to dive in and make an impact.
